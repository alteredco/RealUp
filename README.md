### Github repo: https://github.com/alteredco/RealUp.git
Use latest version of node:
nvm install 10.11.0
nvm use 10.11.0
nvm alias default 10.11.0
node -v
should return: V10.11.0
To start:
Git clone https://github.com/alteredco/RealUp.git

npm install to install all depencies
npm start

#When adding react / npm components
npm install react-bootstrap --save
this saves the dependcies to package.json (and so does not break the app after you push to your-branch, merge to master and re-pull latest master with git pull origin master).
